# pythonPasswordGenerator

<p>This is a standalone program that will create, store, and retrieve passwords.  First Version will be a console made program as a proof of concept and working kinks out, with a final version having a GUI.</p>

<p>This is just a project i like to do, much like little <a href="https://github.com/matthewBeckwith/TeachBradPython_Tic-Tac-Toe/tree/gfx">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> Games or 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' to keep me programming and learning and becoming more efficient as a programmer overall. I thought, maybe others would like to see instead of just throwing them away and rebuilding again at a later date... enjoy!</p>

# Known Bugs -

<p>As of right now, I have not completed the searching for passwords nor showing all passwords.  So if you try to do either of those, it will just print to the screen and nothing more.  Aside from that, let me know if you find anything.</p>
